/**
 * Models should be kept in a seprate file (models.js)
 * Model = a class that constructs documents according to a specified schema, 
 * similar to how a table in SQL specifies all the properties, data types, 
 * and other settings (e.g., if theyâ€™re required) for the data it stores. 
 * A model specifies what data to store and how to store it for each document in a collection. 
 * This whole process is often referred to as business logic.
 * Execute npm install mongoose (or npm install mongoose --save),  install locally
 * -You must have MondoDB running before this command
